A simple, hackable software for the international education industry. http://haboo.org

What?
Haboo derived from the Japanese word ‘Habu' meaning ‘Hub’, and that’s what we are creating, An open source infrastucture for sales, thorough tracking and optimised communication for the International Education Industry.
Our aim is to create a non-proprietary ecosystem  to connect all stake holders, faster, better, globally and for free.

Why?
Today all services offered to industry stakeholders are proprietary and we believe that in order to create a healthy industry, improve products and services in the same speed of all contemporary technological advancements, we should create an open source framework to connect Education Providers, Agents and Students. The idea behind it is to create a free form of collaboration, to improve knowledge, track effectiviness and boost productivity.

Benefits
Affordability and speed
Open-source licenses are free, so developers can obtain the software and get right to work. Once a developer is working on this software, it’s easy to move quickly. And with multiple developers working on the same project in real time, the end product can be produced that much faster.

Flexibility
Open source frees your business from contract lock-in. You get to pick and choose what technologies you want to use. If one doesn’t work according to your expectations, you can easily switch to an alternative.

Reliability
Another benefit is the software’s dependability. Because each person who touches the code makes it better and more efficient, the software is highly reliable. If a problem does arise, the open-source community can quickly step in to correct the issue.

Community
That leads us to another advantage of open-source software: the open-source community. Companies don’t have to rely on a single person or a small team for development with open-source technology. If someone is off sick or on holiday and a rush project comes up, another open-source developer can step right in and continue the creation process. This community is extremely passionate and accessible, and it provides myriad resources about development.

Share!
Haboo is an open source project.
